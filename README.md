# Tom-Rumore-Portfolio

The motivation behind the creation of this project was to create a multi-page responsive portfolio. The intent being to create a jumping off point that will include both personal and professional information so that it may continuously be added to and changed as my expertise in coding evolves and I can include more detailed projects which I have built.
